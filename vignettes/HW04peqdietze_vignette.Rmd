# myseq_n Function Usage

This function is defined by a recursive sequence. That is, element n is the sum of element n−1 and the difference between elements n−2 and n−3 divided by n. This function takes as input a vector x containing a three element sequence and a positive integer n denoting the final nth element of the sequence to calculate. The function returns element n.

# Example code
